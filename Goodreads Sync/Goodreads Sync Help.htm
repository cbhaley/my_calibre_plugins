<h2><a name="_Toc326445870">Introduction</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Goodreads plugin was designed to allow integration
between the books that you manage in calibre and your reading list shelves that
you maintain with your Goodreads.com account.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With this plugin you can:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Add books from calibre to a shelf in Goodreads, optionally
     applying actions such as setting custom column values, uploading a rating,
     date read or review columns.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Sync the contents of Goodreads shelves to books in calibre.
     Apply actions such as adding tags or setting values in custom columns or
     downloading rating/date read/review text.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>View your shelves or the details of a book on the
     Goodreads website from calibre</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Build a tags column on your books based on which of your
     Goodreads shelves they are on. Alternatively add books to Goodreads
     shelves based on a tags column.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="_Toc326445871">Creating a User Profile</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your first step if you have not already will be to setup an
account with <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads.com</a>. This plugin
will work with multiple Goodreads accounts, so if you happen to share your PC
with other users (and do not each have a separate logon) this is able to be
supported by the plugin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within the Goodreads plugin configuration dialog, you will
initially be prompted for a name for your first account. If you have only a
single account to setup, the name is irrelevant. If you have multiple, the name
will appear in the submenus for certain actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, click on the <b>Authorize Plugin with Goodreads</b>
button. This will launch a web browser allowing you to login to Goodreads.com
with the user account you want associated with the calibre profile you just
selected. Once you are logged in, click the <b>Allow access</b> button on the
web page displayed. You can now close your web browser.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally back in calibre confirm the dialog question being
asked. If everything has been successful, a list of your Goodreads shelves will
be displayed. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc326445872">Goodreads Shelf Configuration</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The list of shelves and book counts displayed on the
configuration dialog reflect those available the last time the list was
refreshed. To update this list, click on the <b>Refresh</b> button located to
the right. This will update the counts of books on each shelf, and add/remove
any custom shelves you have created in Goodreads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that refreshing your shelves list will <b>not</b>
result in you losing any sync actions you have created.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <b><i>Active </i></b>column checkbox for each shelf
reflects whether it will appear in your menus. You may decide for example that
your ‘currently-reading’ shelf requires no synchronisation or management from calibre.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <b><i>Shelf Name</i></b> column includes an icon for
each shelf. The red shelf icons indicate that a shelf is ‘exclusive’ according
to how it was setup on Goodreads. Exclusive shelves mean that the book can only
appear on one of your shelves at a time. So adding a book to your
‘currently-reading’ shelf and then adding it to your ‘read’ shelf will remove
it from the ‘currently-reading’ shelf as they are exclusive shelves by default.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The<b><i> Count*</i></b> column is purely informational and
is not kept up to date by any actions you perform in calibre. You must click
the <b>Refresh</b> button if you wish to view the latest count information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <b><i>Shelf Add Actions</i></b> column reflects any
rules you have setup in the plugin for use with the <b>Add to shelf</b> menu
option. When this menu option is chosen, any actions which you have specified
will be applied for each book in calibre added to the shelf, such as adding a
value to a custom column or a tag. To edit these actions, either right-click,
or click the <b>Edit Sync Actions</b> button to the right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <b><i>Sync Actions</i></b> column reflects any rules you
have setup in the plugin for use with the <b>Sync from shelf</b> menu option.
When this menu option is chosen, any actions which you have specified will be
applied for each book in calibre that matches a book on that Goodreads shelf.
To edit these actions, either right-click, or click the <b>Edit Sync Actions</b>
button to the right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can multiple select shelves before clicking the edit
button to configure all selected shelves to have the same actions.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc326445873">Setting your Goodreads Shelf Add or Sync Actions</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Selecting a shelf in the configuration dialog and choosing <b>Edit
Shelf Add Actions </b>or<b> Edit Sync Actions</b> will present a new dialog
listing any actions that you wish to apply for books being added or synced from
that shelf respectively. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For instance, you might setup a rule to set a <b><span
style='color:#E36C0A'>#read</span></b> custom column in calibre to <b><span
style='color:#E36C0A'>Y</span></b> when a book is added to your <b><span
style='color:#E36C0A'>read</span></b> shelf in Goodreads. There are also
checkboxes available for synchronising your calibre rating and/or date read columns
(see below). You might specify an additional rule to remove a <b><span
style='color:#E36C0A'>ToRead</span></b> tag from that book. The flexibility is
there for as many actions as you wish. Note that currently this plugin only
supports actions for text, comments, datetime and yes/no custom columns, along
with the <b><span style='color:#E36C0A'>tags</span></b> column.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Use the <b>Add</b> and <b>Remove</b> buttons (+/-) to add/remove
actions to your list.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc326445874">Additional Configuration Options</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>From the plugin configuration dialog you can also specify:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>When linking to Goodreads...</b> – controls options for
     updating the ISBN with the value found on Goodreads whenever a calibre
     book is “linked” with a Goodreads book using this plugin. You can choose
     never to overwrite the calibre value, overwrite only if the calibre book
     does not have an ISBN, or always overwrite.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Display the ‘Add to shelf’ menu option</b> – allows you
     to hide this menu option from appearing to simplify your menu if you do
     not use it. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Display the ‘Remove from shelf’ menu option</b> –
     allows you to hide the menu option for removing items from a Goodreads shelf.
     Note that removing from a shelf marked as exclusive can result in
     unexpected behaviour. For instance if you accidentally added a book to
     your ‘to-read’ shelf, then chose to remove it using this option, Goodreads
     would move it to your ‘read’ shelf. The only way to remove books from all
     exclusive shelves is to use the <b>View shelf</b> menu option and click on
     the web page next to each book. Custom shelves which you do not have
     marked as ‘exclusive’ in Goodreads do not have this problem. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Display the ‘Sync from shelf’ menu option</b> – allows
     you to hide this menu option from appearing to simplify your menu if you
     do not use it. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>If adding empty books, store author as LN, FN</b> – the
     Goodreads website always returns authors in FN LN format. On the Sync from
     shelf dialog you have the option of creating empty books in calibre for
     unlinked books on your Goodreads shelf, which will copy data from
     Goodreads into the calibre empty book. If you prefer in calibre you author
     to be displayed as LN, FN for those empty books then check this option.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Synchonisable Custom Columns: Tags column – </b>specify
     the calibre column that will be used for the <b>Download tags from shelves</b>
     and <b>Upload tags as shelves</b> menu options. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Synchonisable Custom Columns: Rating column – </b>specify
     the calibre column that will be the source and/or destination for Rating
     if synchronising the rating column to and/or from Goodreads. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Synchonisable Custom Columns: Date read column – </b>specify
     the calibre column that will be the source and/or destination for Date
     Read if synchronising the date read column to and/or from Goodreads. </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="_Toc326445875">Synchronise Rating, Date Read and/or Review Text Columns</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>For each shelf (though most likely this would only apply to
your <b><span style='color:#E36C0A'>read</span></b> shelf or similar) you can
specify whether to:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Upload your calibre rating, date read and/or review text custom
     column to Goodreads when adding a book to a shelf. You will have the
     opportunity to edit the rating and date read columns from within the <b>Add
     to shelf...</b> dialog. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Overwrite your calibre rating, date read and/or review
     text custom column with the Goodreads value when syncing from that shelf.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>To enable this functionality you must do three things:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>You must have created your custom columns in calibre,
     using Preferences -&gt; Add your own columns, if you are not storing the
     Goodreads data values in one of the standard calibre columns (which you
     cannot do for date read!). Note that you will probably want a Review custom
     column to be of type “Comments” to allow multi-line html text (though you
     can only comfortably edit such text in the Edit Metadata dialog). It is
     permissible to use a column of type ‘Text’ though you may find editing/viewing
     in calibre more awkward, though convenient for very short reviews!</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Choose the appropriate column names in the <b>Customize
     plugin...</b> dialog for <b>Rating column</b>, <b>Date read column </b>and/or
     <b>Review text column</b> in the <b>Synchronisable Custom Columns</b>
     section.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>On one or more shelves, edit the shelf add or sync actions
     (as appropriate) to tick the relevant checkbox(s) specifying rating, date
     read and/or review text should be synced.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="_Toc326445876">Adding Books to Shelves</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you select one or more books in calibre and choose the <b>Add
to shelf...</b> menu option, the dialog that appears allows you to choose one
or more Goodreads shelves to add your book to. You can filter the list of
shelves to just those marked as <b>Active</b> according to how you enabled them
on the <b>Configure plugin</b> dialog. You cannot select multiple exclusive
shelves, because by their nature it is not possible for a book to appear on
more than one exclusive shelf at once.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A <b>Status</b> column displays whether each book you have
selected is ready to be added to the shelf by virtue of being linked via a
Goodreads Id (see more on Linking books to Goodreads below). Only books that
have links can be added to a shelf when you click on the <b>Add to Shelf</b>
button. If a book does not have a link, but does have an ISBN, the plugin will
have attempted to link automatically for you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If any of the shelve(s) you have selected to add the book(s)
to have rating or date read column checkboxes enabled (as per above) then you
can also directly edit those values in this dialog. A date read column will
default to today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For all books that are linked, once you click on the <b>Add
to Shelf</b> button they will be added to the selected shelves (regardless of
whether the books are already on them). If enabled the rating and/or date read
column values for those books will be assigned to your review for those books
on Goodreads. Finally, the new rating/date read values if changed will be
written to the calibre database for those added books.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that books that were not linked are effectively ignored
– they are not uploaded to Goodreads, and any changes to rating/date read
columns are discarded.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc326445877">Syncing from Shelves</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you select the <b>Sync from shelf...</b> menu option,
you will be presented with a list of one or more shelves to sync from. Note
that for performance reasons you should limit your sync actions to the minimum
shelves and shelf size possible – see the ‘Important note about bulk
operations’ later in this document.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only shelves that have some kind of sync action specified
can be synchronised from. So in the <b>Configure plugin...</b> dialog for this
plugin, for each shelf you want to sync from you must have used the <b>Edit
sync actions</b> option to either specify actions to be applied to calibre
column(s), or have configured the rating and/or date read columns to be synced
from.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you have selected a shelf and clicked ok, you will be
displayed a dialog showing all of the book(s) on those Goodreads shelve(s).
There are additional columns showing the calibre book information from the
linked books – see the Linking books section for further details. Note that if
you have books on your Goodreads shelf that have no equivalent in calibre you
have the option of creating an empty book via the right-click menu, to allow
them to be synced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bottom part of this dialog reminds you what action(s)
will take place when you complete the sync operation for all of the books that
are linked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Clicking on the <b>Sync Now </b>button will for all linked
books apply the specified actions to your columns, as well as updating the
rating and date read columns if configured.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc326445878">Download Tags from Goodreads Shelves</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>An alternate way of tagging your books is to use the <b>Download
tags from shelves</b> menu option. Say for instance you have a series of
shelves representing genres like <b><span style='color:#E36C0A'>science-fiction</span></b>,
<b><span style='color:#E36C0A'>romance</span></b>, <b><span style='color:#E36C0A'>adventure</span></b>
etc. Rather than setting up a sync action for each shelf to set the appropriate
tag for the books on it, you can instead select your linked books and have tags
applied based on the shelves they are on. This feature is only available for
books you have linked to Goodreads that are on one or more of your shelves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is quite possible that there is not a 1:1 mapping between
your Goodreads shelf names and your desired calibre tag names. Perhaps some
shelves your books are on you may not want to map tags to such as <b><span
style='color:#E36C0A'>currently-reading</span></b>. The <b>Configure plugin</b>
dialog allows you to edit the mappings for each shelf. Clear the tag field
completely for any shelf you do not want to create a tag for. You can specify
multiple calibre tags if you so wish – for instance a <b><span
style='color:#E36C0A'>paranormal-romance</span></b> shelf could map to tags of <b><span
style='color:#E36C0A'>Paranormal, Romance</span></b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that you can alternately specify a custom column as the
target for your shelf mappings rather than using the main <b><span
style='color:#E36C0A'>tags</span></b> column. So you might set up a custom
column <b><span style='color:#E36C0A'>#genre</span></b><span style='color:#E36C0A'>
</span>dedicated to your Genre and in the <b>Configure plugin</b> dialog choose
this column to be the destination for your shelf mappings with the <b>Tags
column </b>dropdown. You might also choose to setup your tags or custom column
to be hierarchical for display in the tag browser. For more information on
hierarchical tags <a
href="http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=125004">see this thread</a>
on the calibre forums.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note also that there is a difference in behaviour between
choosing the target column to be the <b><span style='color:#E36C0A'>tags</span></b>
column versus it being a custom column. When it is a <b><span style='color:
#E36C0A'>tags</span></b> column, the plugin assumes it is not safe to erase all
tags in that column when you use this feature (as tags are frequently used for
other purposes). So it will always append new mapped values. The implication is
that if you move a book between shelves and then use this download feature
again, it will not erase whatever previously mapped tag value it had. So you
will have to do this manually.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If however you set your target column to be a custom column
such as a <b><span style='color:#E36C0A'>#genre </span></b>column, then the
plugin assumes that column is dedicated for this purpose. So it will always
erase values from the custom column and overwrite with the new shelf values
each time you use this feature. Hence a custom column is the best choice for
use with this feature.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc326445879">Upload Tags as Goodreads Shelves</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is possible to add books to shelves in Goodreads based on
the tags you have applied to them. This feature uses the exact same mappings
and column specified for the <b>Download tags from shelves</b> option above.
This may offer a more convenient alternative to repeatedly filtering your
search results to just select the rows of a specific genre to then add to your
genre specific shelf using the <b>Add to shelf</b> menu option.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You <b>cannot</b> however use this feature as a way to “clean
your calibre tags”. If you specify multiple calibre tags for a Goodreads shelf
in your mappings, you are in effect saying that a book must have <b>all</b>
those tags for it to be assigned to that shelf. So a <b><span style='color:
#E36C0A'>paranormal-romance</span></b> shelf with calibre tags of <b><span
style='color:#E36C0A'>Paranormal, Romance</span></b> will only have books added
to it with both those tags present. A book with just the <b><span
style='color:#E36C0A'>Romance</span></b> tag would not – you are instead able
to map that separately to a <b><span style='color:#E36C0A'>romance</span></b>
shelf in Goodreads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To use this feature, you should perform the following steps:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Place tag values on your books either in the tags column
     or in a custom column representing the value you want mirrored as a
     Goodreads shelf. E.g. placing a <b><span style='color:#E36C0A'>Science
     Fiction</span></b> tag on your relevant books.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Create the matching shelf on Goodreads, either using their
     website or clicking on the button located on the plugin configuration
     dialog. E.g. create a shelf called <b><span style='color:#E36C0A'>science-fiction</span></b></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Use the <b>Customize plugin</b> dialog to specify which
     column to read the tags from or custom column name. In addition ensure you
     have a mapping in place for the (in this example) <b><span
     style='color:#E36C0A'>science-fiction</span></b> shelf with a<span
     style='color:#E36C0A'> <b>Science Fiction</b></span> tag</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Ensure your books have been linked to Goodreads, either
     from being previously added to a shelf (or synced) or using the <b>Link to
     Goodreads</b> option.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Select the books and use the <b>Linked Book -&gt; Upload
     tags as shelves</b> menu option.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="_Toc326445880">Linking calibre Books to Goodreads Books</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The biggest challenge for this plugin is identifying the
matching book between the record stored in calibre and that stored in
Goodreads. While many books have an ISBN which can be useful, not all do, or it
may not as yet have been populated in calibre. In addition, many of the
programming API calls that Goodreads supply rely on using their own Goodreads
id.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The solution taken by this plugin is to enable storing the
Goodreads id for a book in the calibre database. It is stored as an identifier
called <b>goodreads </b>which you can see in the IDs field of the Edit Metadata
dialog. A book linked to goodreads will also have a hyperlink called <b>Goodreads</b>
appear in the book details panel on the right side of calibre for each linked
book, allowing you to navigate directly to the Goodreads website page for that
book. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is also possible to display this identifier as a column
in the GUI – see the first post of this plugin thread at the end of this help
document.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once a link is established either automatically or manually
by yourself, you will not be prompted again for that book. Note that if you
incorrectly linked a book such as it having the wrong title/author at the time
there is no validation – it is your responsibility to re-link it. See the Known
Issues section below for more information on this.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc326445881">Linking using the Goodreads metadata download
plugin</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a metadata download plugin called <b>Goodreads</b>
which you can use to download book metadata in the same way as the plugins that
come with calibre such as Amazon. If you have used this plugin with a book, it
will populate the <b>goodreads</b> identifier.<b> </b></p>

<h2><a name="_Toc326445882">Linking using ‘Add to Shelf’ / ‘Remove from Shelf’</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you perform an action like <b>Goodreads -&gt; Add to
shelf</b>, the plugin first looks to see whether you have already linked the calibre
book to a Goodreads one. If you have not, it will attempt to automatically
match on ISBN if that is present on the calibre book. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If that fails, you will still have the opportunity via the
preview dialog with <b>Search Goodreads</b> to do a search on title/author
against Goodreads to find a matching book. In addition from that search results
dialog you have the ability to launch a search using the Goodreads website. You
can drag/drop a book URL back onto the results dialog for selection. If you
cancel the action, the link will be discarded.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc326445883">Linking using ‘Link with Goodreads’</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Should you wish, you might choose to do this “linking” as a
separate workflow activity, such as after adding a new book to calibre. Choose
the <b>Goodreads -&gt;</b> <b>Link with Goodreads </b>menu option, which will
perform the same checks indicated above of matching ISBN then title/author. You
can identify which books have a Goodreads id set by whether the menu option of <b>Goodreads
-&gt;</b> <b>View linked book </b>is enabled when you right-click on that book.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc326445884">Linking using ‘Sync from Shelf’</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>A third approach to linking takes place when you choose <b>Goodreads
-&gt; Sync from shelf</b>. In this circumstance the search to establish links
occurs in the opposite direction as your starting point is a list of Goodreads
book on the shelf. calibre is queried to find any books matching the Goodreads
id for each book from a previous link. If no match is found, calibre is queried
for a matching ISBN to the Goodreads book. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If that fails, the user has the ability from the sync preview
dialog using <b>Search calibre </b>to issue a search against calibre for a
match on title and author. This performs a “fuzzy” search to increase the
likelihood of finding a match in calibre, in case minor differences in
punctuation, spacing or ordering of words like “A” and “The” differ. In the calibre
search results dialog, you also have the ability to perform direct queries
against calibre to find the book, in case the metadata is incorrect in your
database such as misspelled words.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc326445885">Linking using ‘Add empty book’</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course it is possible that you have no matching book when
you attempt to sync from a Goodreads shelf. For instance you sync with your <b><span
style='color:#E36C0A'>read</span></b> shelf in which contains paperbacks you do
not have calibre records for. A right-click option of <b>Add empty book</b> is
available from the sync preview dialog to handle this situation.  Once you
click <b>Sync now</b> a record for each book you have flagged with that action
is created in calibre, linked to the corresponding Goodreads book and sync
actions can be applied as per normal.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc326445886">Important Note About Bulk Operations</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Goodreads have Terms &amp; Conditions associated with their
API that this plugin is dependent upon. The T&amp;C place a very strict limit
on the throughput of calls being made. The more successful this plugin is and
the more users that perform actions like adding to shelves etc, the greater the
risk of the plugin being banned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>If you ignore this warning the plugin will stop working
for everyone (including you) and there is no workaround.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To discourage users from bulk operations using the plugin
there is a limit of 50 selected rows for the actions of add to shelves/remove
from shelves. If you have more books you wish to add in bulk to the Goodreads
website, export them from calibre as a CSV catalog and upload to the Goodreads
website. For more details see <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/import">http://www.goodreads.com/review/import</a>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Note also that adding many hundreds of books to a shelf
and either syncing or add/removing to it from calibre using this plugin will be
slow and also potentially cause issues.</b> Every time you do actions with your
shelves the entire contents of that shelf are read (200 books at a time). I
cannot think of a genuine reason for having an enormous amount of books on a
Goodreads shelf (apart from your “read” shelf which will grow over time). So do
not for instance be tempted to put your entire collection of thousands of books
on your <b><span style='color:#E36C0A'>to-read</span></b> shelf from this
plugin! Apart from running very slowly for you, the risk of all users being
disabled becomes far higher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you do have genuine reasons for wanting a lot of books on
your shelf and adding to it from calibre regularly, please post on the plugin
thread and state what they are. I may need to make further changes to the
plugin design to attempt to handle this scenario.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc326445887">Known Issues</a></h2>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Goodreads have a limitation on the data they can expose
     via their search API. So when you choose a menu option to search for a
     Goodreads book to link to for a title/author search you will sometimes
     have no results coming back, yet the book will be found when you click on
     the button to search via the website.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Historically, Goodreads have had a bug in their API which prevents
     this plugin from reading the contents of a shelf if it contains some
     particular books. I have raised this as an issue on the Goodreads bug
     forums <a
     href="http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/496121-badly-formed-xml-in-response-from-list-xml">here</a>
     and their subsequent fix appears to be working. Any books which cause this
     error that are on your shelf will not appear for display with this plugin.
     This symptom can also happen if Goodreads happen to have their website
     down for maintenance.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>If your title/author/isbn data in calibre is incorrect at
     the time you link, and you later correct it in calibre, you will still be
     linked to the “wrong” book in Goodreads. If this situation occurs, choose
     the <b>Goodreads -&gt; Link to Goodreads </b>menu option to create a new
     link for the correct book once you have edited your metadata.</li>
</ul>
