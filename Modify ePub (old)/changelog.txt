Fixed minor bug in "stripkobo" option that missed some Kobo artifacts inside the HEAD element.
Fixed minor spacing bugs in "unpretty" option.
Enhancement to "stripkobo", "stripspans", and "unpretty" options: All three now remove </br> and </hr> tags and always make BR and HR self-closing elements. (This fixes invalid <br> and <hr> markup, if such is present.)
Moved "stripkobo", "stripspans", and "unpretty" into the "Known artifacts" category to balance the dialog box better.
Added some code to dialogs.py to make the dialog box scrollable on smaller screens.

Add a "stripspans" option to allow removal of attributeless <span> elements from markup, as well as normalizing empty <x></x> elements to the <x/> form.
Add a "stripkobo" option to allow removal of the Kobo-specific code from kepub books, transforming them into standard EPUB books. This does NOT remove Kobo's DRM.
Note: Both of the above will also completely remove A, B, I, U, BIG, SMALL, EM, SPAN, and STRONG elements from the markup when those elements have neither attributes nor content.
Add an "unpretty" option to de-indent and otherwise reformat HTML elements in markup. This should have no effect on the rendered content; it only cleans the source code up a bit.
